        <span>What is pair programming?</span> <br><br>
        Pair programming is when two people program together.
        It's a way for people to put their heads together on a project.
        This is useful because no two people have the same expertise and the same
        knowledge, and pair programming enables programmers to pick other programmers'
        brains. It also enables people to teach each other new things; pair programming
        is as much a teaching experience as it is a learning experience.

        <span>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</span> <br><br>
        Pair programming is important to DBC because in the workplace, developers
        pair program often. Since the ability to pair program will be expected of
        developers, DBC wants us to get experience pair programming so that we are good
        at it by the time we enter the workforce.

        <span>Compare Driver and Navigator</span><br><br>
        The driver codes and the navigator guides the driver and does the research.
        The navigator ensures that the code is both accurate and efficient, and
        catches any mistakes that may arise.

        <span>Personal Preferences</span><br><br>
        Dee prefers to drive while Rebecca prefers to navigate.
        Rebecca likes to navigate because she prefers to do research. Also, she feels like when she is the driver she gives up control and doesn't like having to wait to be told what to do when she already knows what she wants to do. This means that she sometimes gets ahead of the navigator, which is something she needs to work on.
        Dee prefers to drive because he can go at his own pace.

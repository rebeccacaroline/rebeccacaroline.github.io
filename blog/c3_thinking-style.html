      When I took the learning style quiz, I learned that I am multi-modal, with a larger emphasis on kinesthetic and a smaller emphasis on visual and read/ write. I'm not really an aural learner at all. The way that I learn the best is reading or seeing something done, and then right away doing it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best way to describe this is by explaining my training for my current job. My supervisor gave me a 100 page training manual on my first day and told me to read through it. This manual explained every step of the projects I would be working on, from the launch to post-delivery. It was hard for me to focus because I couldn't envision working on any steps past step 1. When I got my first project, I had the training manual open next to me as I worked and I referenced it for each step. Now, I don't need my training manual except for when I have questions about unusual circumstances.
    </p>

      My thinking style is Abstract Sequential. I need references, and when I see non-fiction I need to be able to check sources. I feel most comfortable when I am confident in my abilities and have time to sort out problems. I like to work alone, do research, analyze arguments, and follow traditional procedures instead of figuring out new ways of doing things.
    </p>
    <p>
      My biggest struggle thus far has been focusing on the articles that are assigned for reading. It's hard for me to imagine scenarios to apply the lessons without working through the scenarios myself. I wish there were more practice problems in A Well-Grounded Rubyist and in Learning to Program, because I know I need to have more targeted practice on coding where I can really apply the lessons I've learned that week. I have been doing some research on Ruby practice online, and I will continue to look for more resources where I can practice solving problems with Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Abstract Sequential thinkers prefer to work alone and work systematically, it can be hard for me to fit peer pairing into my assignment schedule for the week. I'm trying to be more flexible and to jump in more often when people say they need help or when I need help. I'm lucky that there are so many sources on Ruby and HTML and CSS and Git like Stack Exchange, Stack Overflow and many other sites, because being able to delve deeper and have more references is important for an Abstract Sequential thinker.

      I know that I struggle with a fixed mindset, but the cultural assignments thus far have helped me with that. This week I've really tried to embrace my ignorance by reaching out to pair with people when I was struggling with some of the exercises. One of my partners helped with exercise 19, and when we said goodbye she said that if I need help on exercise 20 I shouldn't hesitate to reach out. I did have trouble with exercise 20, but part of me was feeling embarrassed about asking for help again after I'd just asked for help on the previous exercise. I thought about the supportive community that DBC is trying to foster, and I thought "Am I really going to not figure out this exercise because I'm embarrassed over something I'm not supposed to be embarrassed about?" So I got over it  and I asked for help again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moral of that story was that I am trying to foster more of a growth mindset, but it is unnatural for me. I will keep in mind that I'm part of a supportive community and that there will be someone available to help when I need it. I will try this weekend to help people who need help, and I will reach out on the Google+ page next week when I need help again.
      And, I will keep doing practice Ruby problems.

      Thanks for reading about my learning struggles this week!

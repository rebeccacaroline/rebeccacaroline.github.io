      I just watched the Fireside Chat with Shereef: Kitchen vs. Table. The video explains the philosophy behind Dev Bootcamp and the culture that Shereef hopes for Dev Bootcamp. He used the analogy of chefs in the kitchen vs. guests at a table. While our culture trains us to look at education like we are guests at a table, passively receiving information and consuming it, Shereef says that he sees Dev Bootcamp as more of a kitchen, with everyone pitching in together to take control of what we learn, to create our own meal.

        The culture at Dev Bootcamp is a large reason why I chose Dev Bootcamp over any other programming bootcamp. I am inspired by the commitment to creativity and to empowering the students to take control of their own education. Since programming is such a new field for me (I have a degree in History), it is important for me to take advantage of all the resources available to me and to learn in as many ways as possible.

        I am definitely ready to embrace this life changing experience. During my prep period, I took the Coursera Learning How to Learn class and one lesson that resonated with me was that since adrenaline signals fear and excitement, when feeling scared about a new experience you can easily choose to interpret your fear as excitement. I am nervous about how hard this experience will be. But I am also excited, and I'm choosing to be more excited than nervous.

      Making my blog and my website as a whole look professional is an ongoing project. I feel a little weird reflecting on it now because I don't feel finished. That said, if I wait until I really feel done, I'll be writing this blog post in the year 2100.

      I've really liked the creativity and control I've been able to have over this process. While the open-ended nature of this project has been frustrating and daunting at times, it's exciting to look back and think, 'I did this all by myself.' The amount that I have done has surprised me, and I'm proud of all that I've done.

      The hardest part is comparing my website to the websites of others. I look at my website and it's really simple. I want to add more, but I don't want it to look tacky or too busy. When I look through the twitter feed and see other student's websites, I'm really impressed. I don't want to stop working on my website until I feel like it looks as good. This feeling isn't sustainable; there's always going to be a better website than mine and all I can do is focus on my own work.

      Another hard part about the process of building a website is getting feedback. Most of the feedback I've gotten is "It looks really good!" That's nice for my ego, but doesn't tell me how I can make my website better. Also the people saying that are my friends, who have to say that. In my situation, since I feel like my website is too simple, I understand that it's hard for people to advise me what to add. If my website were too busy, it would be easy for someone to pinpoint "Hey Rebecca, do you really NEED three hit counters?"

      What I've come to realize in writing this blog post, is that I really need to leave my website alone for a little while. When I come back in a week or so, I'll have a better idea of what I want my website to look like. Until then, take a look around!

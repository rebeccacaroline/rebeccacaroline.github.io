      At my previous job as a translation project coordinator, I got a lot of practice in asking good, efficient questions. This is because most of the consultants I interacted with were not native English speakers who did not know the exact specifications of my job. I realized that the first step in asking a good question is identifying exactly what problem the answer is going to solve. Only then can you formulate a question that will find the right answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      My job was to organize translation projects and to oversee the quality assurance checks. When asking questions to non-native English speakers (often in other countries), I learned that questions have to be specific and technical. One of the main issues we had was changes to an existing translation. My company maintained that there are many different ways to translate a sentence, so changes should be limited to grammatical or spelling errors as opposed to stylistic preferences. This is where the questions come in. Often, it would be a second translator who would come to me and say "This translation is wrong - this word does not fit in this context." I would have to report back to the first translator and ask, "Is this an error, or is this a stylistic change?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When I first started at the company, I would ask the first translator "Is this change necessary?" I would get answers like "Well, no, unless you want the sentence to be understood in a certain way. Both translations are understandable." That did not help me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I would ask, "Is there an error in the first translation?" The answers would be "It's not an error, it's just a different word." That did not help me either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, I started asking questions like "The original English can be understood as _____. Is the change being suggested necessary in order for the sentence to be understood that way as well? Is there a grammatical or a spelling error in the first translation? Or is the suggestion merely stylistic?" Once I made sure that my questions were specific and understandable and explained exactly what I needed did I start getting answers that helped me.
    </p>
    <p>
      This lesson in asking good questions has helped so far in Phase 0, because I have learned to recognize exactly what I need answered. Before, I did not realize exactly what I needed answered, so I was not sure what to ask. Now that I can pinpoint exactly what I need help with, or what question I need answered, I can ask specific questions that are tailored to what I need.

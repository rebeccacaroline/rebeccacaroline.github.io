    <h4>What is an array?</h4>
      <p>
        An array is an object that can hold a lot of data. Unlike a variable or a constant which only hold one piece of data at a time, an array can hold many pieces. For example, you can have an array of cats like so:
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em; margin: 0px 250px 0px 250px;"><pre style="margin: 0px; line-height: 125%">cats = [<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;cheshire&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;calico&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;russian blue&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;siamese&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;persian&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;sphynx&quot;</span>]
          </pre></div>
      <p>As you can see, instead of just one cat, we can have whole <em>array</em> of cats! </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Data in an array is numbered. In order to access data in an array, you need to know the order of the data in the array. Data in arrays is numbered from 0 up. The 0th piece of data in this array is "cheshire." The way I would access this data would be: "cats[0]."
    <h4>What is a hash?</h4>
      <p>
        A hash is similar to an array in that it can hold multiple pieces of data. However, a hash is different from an array in that the data is not numbered, and each piece of data is a key/value pair. This means that in a hash there are a certain amount of keys and each key corresponds to one value. Keys must be unique, but values do not have to be. Here is an example of a hash with cats:
          <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em; margin: 0px 250px 0px 250px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">cats = {
          <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;favorite&quot;</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;russian blue&quot;</span>,
          <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;ugly&quot;</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;sphinx&quot;</span>,
          <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;scary&quot;</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;cheshire&quot;</span>,
          <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;spoiled&quot;</span> =&gt; <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;siamese&quot;</span>
          }
          </pre></div>
      </p>
      <p>
        With a hash, I don't need to know the order of the data or even the values, I just need to know the keys. I can ask Ruby to tell me which cat is scary by asking "puts cats["scary"]" and Ruby will tell me that the Cheshire cat is scary.
      </p>
    <h4> When to use an array over a hash</h4>
      <p>
        You want to use an array instead of a hash when you have an ordered list that you want to be able to keep track of by placement in a list. For example, if you know you will want to access the data in a list in an ordered manner, you'll want to use an array. This is because you can call cats[1] to get the second value in an array without knowing what the value is. Also if you know you'll want to iterate over values in a list in an ordered way, arrays are the way to go.
      </p>
    <h4>When to use a hash over an array</h4>
      <p>
        You want to use a hash instead of an array when you don't want your data to be in order. If you just want a collection of key/value pairs that are in no particular order (for example my cats hash) you would use a hash. In my cats hash, the ugly cat is not higher than the scary cat - each key/value pais is essentially at the same level.

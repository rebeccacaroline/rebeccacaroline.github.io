      In reading about computer programming, you may have stumbled upon terms like "statically typed languages" and "dynamic typed languages." If you were me, you probably skimmed over those phrases thinking "That will make more sense as I go along. Look for those context clues!" Well, look for context clues no longer, because I will just flat out explain to you what these mean!
    </p>
    <p>
      In statically typed languages, the compiler of the code checks what kind of object a variable is while it's compiling the code. Types are linked to a variable instead of the value of the variable. Dynamically typed languages check the kind of object a variable is while the code is running. Types are linked to a value instead of the variable. This means that in statically typed languages, errors can be found before the program runs. However, dynamically typed languages are more flexible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Languages that use static typing include Java, C, and C++, among many others. Languages that use dynamic typing include Ruby, JavaScript, and Python. Static typed languages are more conservative, while dynamic typed languages are more liberal and cooperative. Static typed languages are often the older languages, while the newer languages tend to be dynamic. The exception is Scala, which is new but it is statically typed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we have only been working with dynamic typed languages so far, we haven't had to worry about static languages or the difference between the two. We can just write our code, paying no attention to how we have defined the types of our variables. We haven't even had to worry about compilers! If and when we start writing code in static languages, we will have to be more aware of the types of our variables. I assume that this will be a tricky adjustment for people like me who have never written code in a static language.

      A couple of months ago, my roommate called me at 4 AM on a weeknight. She called me, and I'm ashamed to admit I didn't pick up because I hoped it was a butt dial. She called again, and I thought 'Crap she might really be in trouble,' and I picked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "HiI'mattheairportandIcan'tfindmycompanycreditcardIthinkImighthaveleftitathomewouldyoumindlookingforit?" At this point I can't really say no, because I've already answered the phone. "Where did you leave it?" I ask. She responds "maybe the coffee table?" I get out of bed, walk to the living room, and turn on the light. There's no credit card on the coffee table. "Ok, maybe it's on my desk." I turn off the light in the living room, walk to her room, turn on that light (did I mention this was at 4AM?) and there's no credit card on the desk. "Ok, maybe I left it in a pocket. Can you check through my pants?" It wasn't in any pants pocket. "Oh, you know what? It might be in my car. I'll go check my car now." Click. The card was in her car the whole time.
    </p>
    <p>
      I understood that in the heat of the moment, when she was tired and stressed out, that she was panicking and wasn't thinking clearly. But the fact that she didn't apologize or thank me at all after the fact made me feel really disrespected and undervalued. I felt that it wasn't my responsibility to make sure she had her company credit card - I helped her because I didn't want her to get in trouble and I like to be able to help when I can. The fact that she didn't seem to appreciate what I did for her made me feel like she didn't see me as a person - she saw me more as a problem fixer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actions that I took were mostly internal. I didn't feel like it was my place to tell her that she should have apologized or thanked me; if she didn't feel grateful I couldn't force her to thank me. I did realize that, going forward, it is important to set boundaries and manage expectations. This is true not only for this roommate in particular, but for any person that I will live with in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back, I wouldn't do anything differently. I leave my phone on at night because I want to be available in cases of emergency. Even though a missing credit card doesn't exactly qualify as an emergency, it's better to have a false alarm than miss a call when someone really needs me. I do wish that I had set a better precedent with my roommate before this happened, in terms of boundaries and expectations.

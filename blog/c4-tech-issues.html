      During a small party at my apartment, I was telling some friends that I had applied and was accepted to Dev Bootcamp to do an intensive web development course. My boyfriend's friend (who is black and a programmer) came up to me and said "It's really cool that you're doing this. I feel like a lot of people who aren't white or Asian men are turned off by the tech industry. I understand why women wouldn't want to put themselves in a position where there is so much sexism, but it also makes me really sad that women are turned off of programming by the culture of the tech industry." I told him that there was a $500 discount for being a woman, and he laughed. He said "That's a good start, but just know that that $500 isn't going to come close to making up for all the bullshit you're going to have to deal with being a woman in tech."

      The fact that sexism is rampant in the tech industry should surprise no one. In Google's first diversity report, the company found that 70% of all employees worldwide are male. In a 2008 report for the Harvard Business Revew, Laura Sherbin of the Center for Talent Innovation found that over 50% of women in science, technology, and engineering choose to leave, and 63% of women in these fields told Sherbin that they'd experienced sexual harassment. I could quote specific instances of sexism (for example, the Tinder debacle), but then I would be writing this post for the next month.

    <h4>What companies can do to help</h4>
    <p>
      Honestly, writing this blog made me realize that this is a monstrous problem, without a clear solution. I am exhausted and confused and pessimistic. Based on my extensive research, I've found that companies can make their company culture more welcoming and supportive to women by:
      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>
           Holding sexism seminars for men, not just seminars on how to combat sexism for women.
         </li>
         <li>
            Implementing a supportive space for women to have their ideas heard. If an idea is shut down, there should be constructive criticism so the person positing the idea can fully understand how to propose better ideas in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implementing a strict chain of command so that male employees can't cut women out of projects or tasks
          </li>
          <li>
            Instituting a sexual harassment policy with teeth, so that employees realize that comments like "Why did you need to learn to code? You're pretty enough not to." (actual comment I heard when I was in college) are unacceptable.
          </li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Pairing</h4>
    <p>
      My first couple of pairs were during week 1, and I admit I was a little hesitant. It didn't seem like the challenges really lent themselves well to pairing. I felt like it was sort of a waste of time because I could have finished those challenges much faster on my own. Then I learned that we weren't even expected to pair on the week 1 challenges!
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast majority of my pairing experiences since then have been a bunch more positive. When I feel overwhelmed by a challenge and then I pair on it, I am pleasantly surprised by the ease with which we are able to find a solution. While pairing may be less efficient, it's good to be able to bounce ideas off another person and even to think out loud to be able to figure out code. Also, everyone has different knowledge, even two people that came into this program with no coding experience at all. It's helpful to learn from other people's knowledge, I've found.
    </p>
    <h4>Feedback</h4>
    <p>
      Writing feedback is not easy. In fact, I've been guilty of, when I find something obvious to constructively criticize in a pairing session, getting a bit excited that I will know what to say in my feedback. According to the meta feedback I've received, however, I have been getting better at giving actionable and specific feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the meta feedback I received was that my feedback was either not actionable enough, or not specific enough. I was having trouble defining the difference between the two, and figuring out how to be specific yet anonymous. I've figured that actionable and specific are very closely linked - actionable means something that can be actioned on and specific means specifically mentioning what can be actioned on and how that behavior affects a pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rating feedback is also hard. I had the same problem as above regarding the difference between actionable and specific. I wish there were more support on how to best rate feedback.
    </p>
    <h4>Feedback I've Received</h4>
    <p>
      The constructive feedback I've received is that I can be quiet. This means that my pairs can be confused as to where I am in the challenge. Thinking out loud and doing research out loud is unnatural to me, especially when my pair is just a green dot on my tab bar and not actually sitting next to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm aware that this is an issue of mine, and that I need to be more vocal and communicative during my pairing sessions. Going forward, I plan to be more aware of my communication especially when I'm doing research or I'm thinking of a solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, pairing has been good for my learning - my most successful challenges have been pairing challenges. Getting feedback has helped as well as far as being a better pair and a better human being. Giving feedback and rating feedback haven't been as helpful to my own learning, I feel, but of course I couldn't get feedback if no one wrote or rated feedback!

    <h4>Values</h4>
    <p>
      When I started this blog post, I took a look at the list of values and I thought about the times when I was happiest and most proud of myself, and I started jotting values down. I ended up writing down probably half of the list of values. After reading a couple of other blog posts, I realized that most people had chosen one or two values. I had to pare my list down. Therefore, the values that have meant the most to me when I was feeling happy, proud and satisfied are ADVENTURE and SELF-RELIANCE. If I had to rank how much I try to live up to these values from 1-5 (1 being the least and 5 being the most), both these values would be 5s.

      Adventure is important to me because life is short and there is so much in this world to experience. I would hate to limit my life experience in any way because of fear. For me, Dev Bootcamp is an adventure. I'm excited to start a career in the tech industry of course, but I'm also excited to go through the process of Dev Bootcamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel really proud of myself when I'm self-reliant. I feel really strong and I feel like I can take on the world. Oftentimes adventure and self-reliance go hand in hand - I moved to France for a year all by myself, I decided to apply for and matriculate to Dev Bootcamp all by myself, I asked for a raise at my previous job all by myself, and I'm really proud of myself for doing all of those things.

    <h4>Advice</h4>
    <p>
      The last time someone asked me for advice, my friend Molly was asking how to tell her cousin that she would have to work on the day that her cousin had asked Molly to babysit. Molly had previously confirmed that she would babysit, but her company told her (at the last minute) that she was needed at work that day. This doesn't really have anything to do with adventure or self-reliance, but it is related to coolness under fire - one of the other values that I had had on my list. My mom says I'm really good looking objectively at tough situations.

    <h4>Values and Stereotype Threat at DBC</h4>
    <p>
      When I get stuck on a challenge, I think to myself "There's no way that everyone who has graduated from DBC is smarter than me. There's no way that everyone who has graduated from DBC is a harder worker than me. That just defies statistics." When I think about all the people that have graduated and have succeeded, I see that there is no reason why I shouldn't be able to do the same. I never thought about using this thought process in terms of mediating stereotype threat, but I think it will really help. DBC is an adventure and I'm going to make the most of it, and I know that my self-reliance will get me through.

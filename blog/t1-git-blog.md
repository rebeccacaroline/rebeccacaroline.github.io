Git and Version Control

November 20, 2014

Version control is an important part of sharing projects. It enables everyone working on the project to see exactly what changes were made when, and by whom. Version control also enables multiple people to work on the same code at once without having to worry about overwriting or deleting another person's change.

Git helps to keep track of changes in a myriad of ways. There is "git log" which enables a person to see a list of all commits along with a brief synopsis of what was changed with each commit. Also, on Github you can see exactly what was added and what was removed, by whom, and at what time. When you look at a Github repository, it shows what time each file or directory was last updated.

Github is a good place to store code because it is a remote space for multiple people to be able to work together. It is also a space to be able to store projects remotely. For example, if you were at another person's house and you wanted to show that person what you were working on, if you have Github you don't need to go back home and grab your laptop - you can just log in to Github on your friend's computer and your work will be there.

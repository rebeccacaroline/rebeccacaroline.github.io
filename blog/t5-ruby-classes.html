      Classes are ways to basically store a bunch of related methods. If you know that you're going to have more than one object and each object is going to act pretty similarly, you can create a class to streamline the creation of those objects. If that seemed kind of abstract, take a look at this example. This is a class of books, and this will enable the user to create different books. Each book will have a title, an author, a year, and a page length, and the class will be able to calculate the book's cost. Then, the class will spit out a sentence summarizing the data on the book.

      Let's say I wanted to create a new Book instance, with the novel <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen. I would go about that by creating a new class and assigning values to each of the variables. I would then call the methods #cost and #summary.<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em; margin: 0px 250px 0px 250px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%">emma = Book.new(<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;Emma&quot;</span>, <span style="color: #a31515">&quot;Jane Austen&quot;</span>, 1815, 264)
emma.cost
emma.summary
</pre></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      The output of calling the class is the following (this is a limited edition version of the novel, hence the price):
      <!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em; margin: 0px 250px 0px 250px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #a31515">&quot;52.80&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #a31515">&quot;This book, Emma, was written by Jane Austen in 1815 and costs $52.80&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      Instance methods are methods that are inside of classes and are called on <em>instances</em> of the class. They are called instance methods because they are methods that are activated for each instance of the class and not on the class itself. For example, the method #cost, which calculates the cost of the book based on the length of the book, is called on a new book, not on the class "Book." In order to use an instance method, you need to create a new instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what are those little @ symbols? What do those mean? The @ symbol denotes an instance variable. They are active for an entire instance of a class. Without the @ symbol, when I called the summary method I would get errors saying that there was no variable called title, or author, or page_length, or cost. That is because those variables were set in a different method, and the scope of those variables would be inside the different method. Those variables would not exist outside of the methods in which they were assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      You might be what the funny "attr_accessor" at the top means. What this does is creates instance methods and instance variables for each symbol shown. For example, there are four different instance methods implicitly included in this class. Without the attr_accessor, they would all look like this:<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me --><div style="background: #ffffff; overflow:auto;width:auto;border:solid gray;border-width:.1em .1em .1em .8em;padding:.2em .6em; margin: 0px 250px 0px 250px;"><pre style="margin: 0; line-height: 125%"><span style="color: #0000ff">def</span> title
  @title
<span style="color: #0000ff">end</span>
      </pre></div>
    </p>
    <p>
      What the "accessor" part means is that each of these methods are readable AND writeable. When called, the method can both tell you the value and change the value. If you wanted to create a method using "attr" that would only change the value but not read the value, you could use "attr_writer." Conversely, you could also create a method that would only read the value and would not change the value, using "attr_reader."

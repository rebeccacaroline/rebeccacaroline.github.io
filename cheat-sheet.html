                    <span>HTML:</span>
                    <p>A markup language used to structure text and multimedia documents and to set up hypertext links between documents, used extensively on the World Wide Web.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>CSS:</span>
                    <p>A style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Elements:</span>
                    <p>HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between. The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Tags:</span>
                    <p>A command inserted in a document that specifies how the document, or a portion of the document, should be formatted. Tags are used by all format specifications that store documents as text files.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>id:</span>
                    <p>The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Class:</span>
                    <p>The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet.</p>

            </ul>

        <section id="html" class="box">
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>All documents must start with a type declaration: !DOCTYPE html.</p>
            <p>The document itself begins with "html" and ends with "/html".</p>
            <p>The visible part of the document is between "body" and "/body".</p>
            <p>Headings are defined with the h1 to h6 tags.</p>
            <p>Paragraphs are defined with the p tag.</p>
            <p>Links are defined with the a tag. The address is specified in the href attribute. Attributes are used to provide additional information about HTML elements.</p>
            <p>HTML images are defined with the img tag. The source file (src), alternative text (alt), and size (width and height) are provided as attributes.</p>

        <section id="css" class="box">
            <h3>CSS</h3>
            <p>When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML, it started a nightmare for developers. Development of large web sites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, was long and expensive.</p>
            <p>With CSS, you can change the look of an entire Web site by changing just one file!</p>
            <p>The element selector selects elements based on the element name.</p>
            <p>The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.</p>
            <p>The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute.</p>
            <p>You can also group selectors to minimize the code. To do this, separate each selector with a comma.
